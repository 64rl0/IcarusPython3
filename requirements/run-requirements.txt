# Lists “library” (AKA “direct”) dependencies for your package.
#
# These are transitive: anyone that depends on your package
# will automatically pick up these dependencies.
#
# NOTE: New or updated dependencies should be declared in the
# `pyproject.toml` dependencies section. This file is kept for
# legacy tooling compatibility.
